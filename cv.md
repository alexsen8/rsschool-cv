## 3. ***About me*** 


   Hi everyone. I'm from Belarus. I like to learn something new so that's the main reason why Iâ€™m here ;)

## 4. ***Skills***
 
   This is my first week of training, so for now I'm just trying to figure out things that are new to me. Hope, I  can do it.

## 5. ***Code example***
```
const assert = require("chai").assert;

describe("Multiply", () => {
  it("fixed tests", () => {
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(1,1), 1);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,1), 2);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(2,2), 4);
    assert.strictEqual(multiply(3,5), 15);   
  });
});
```

## 6. ***Education***
+ Branch of BSEU "Minsk Financial and Economic College"
+ Belarus State Economic University (The School of Finance and Banking)

## 7. ***Languages***
+ Belarusian language (my native language)
+ Russian
+ English (I'm not sure what level of language I have, I can watch series and movies with English subtitles, can read simple (non-scientific) texts and books, but my spoken English is still bad)
+ Ukrainian language (can read without problems and understand a little bit speaking)
